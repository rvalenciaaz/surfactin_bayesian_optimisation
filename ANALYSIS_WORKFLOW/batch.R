# Preprocessing
# Implement any preprocessing steps here (e.g., filtering, missing value imputation)

# Batch Correction
# Apply batch correction methods here. 
# Example: data_corrected <- removeBatchEffect(data, batch = data$batch)

# Quality Control
# Implement quality control steps here (e.g., QC-RSC)

# Normalization
# Apply normalization methods here.
# Example: data_normalized <- normalize(data_corrected, method = 'quantile')

# Post-processing and Analysis
# Perform further analysis as needed (e.g., statistical testing, clustering, PCA)

# Save or output the processed data
write.csv(data_normalized, 'path_to_output.csv')
